OpenSocial Specification
------------------------

Repository for all versions of the OpenSocial specification.

In order to properly render the OpenSocial specification documents, you need
to view them using Github Pages by replacing http://github.com/OpenSocial/spec/tree/master/ 
with http://opensocial.github.io/spec/ as the root URL.


Making changes to the OpenSocial specification
----------------------------------
 
1. Fork the OpenSocial spec and create a new branch for your changes
   
2. Use your favorite text editor to make any modifications to the
   specification files.  Depending on the type of changes you are making,
   you should edit files in specific directories.

   If you are creating a patch to fix a bug in an existing version of the
   specification (such as a typo or incorrect information) edit the files
   in the subdirectory corresponding with the appropriate spec version. 
   For example, if you are fixing a misspelling in the 0.8 version of the
   specification, edit the files in the "0.8" subdirectory.

   If you are creating a patch to change or add a new feature to the next
   version of the specification, edit the files in the "trunk"
   directory.
   
3. Commit your changes into your branch, push to your remote, and then use
   Github to create a Pull Request for your branch. You will also need to <a href="http://www.clahub.com/agreements/OpenSocial/spec">sign the IPR</a>
   
4. Post the link to your Pull Request from step 3 to the opensocial-and-gadgets-spec
    discussion group.  You may access the group at
    http://groups.google.com/group/opensocial-and-gadgets-spec/topics
    If you are proposing a new feature with your patch, post a new discussion
    topic, otherwise, respond to the appropriate topic with your link.
