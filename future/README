How to create a patch for the spec:

Requirements:
  * Subversion - available from http://subversion.tigris.org/
 
1.) Use Subversion to obtain a copy of the official spec documents.  There are
    a variety of ways to do this, but the easiest way is just to use the
    following command line:
   
    svn co http://opensocial-resources.googlecode.com/svn/spec/ opensocial-spec
   
    This will create a directory named "opensocial-spec" and copy all the
    appropriate files to it.
   
    Windows users may wish to use TortoiseSVN, a graphical frontend to the
    Subversion client: http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/
    Use http://opensocial-resources.googlecode.com/svn/spec/ as the repository
    location when checking out the project.
   
2.) Use your favorite text editor to make any modifications to the
    specification files.  Depending on the type of changes you are making,
    you should edit files in specific directories.

    If you are creating a patch to fix a bug in an existing version of the
    specification (such as a typo or incorrect information) edit the files
    in the subdirectory corresponding with the appropriate spec version. 
    For example, if you are fixing a misspelling in the 0.8 version of the
    specification, edit the files in the "0.8" subdirectory.

    If you are creating a patch to change or add a new feature to the next
    version of the specification, edit the files in the "draft"
    subdirectory.
   
3.) Use Subversion's diff functionality to create a patch with your changes.
    Diffs should be created relative to the top level "opensocial-spec"
    directory and be able to apply without errors using the patch -p0
    command.
   
    Mac and Linux users can run the following command from inside the
    "opensocial-spec" directory to generate the patch file:
   
    svn diff > changes.patch
   
    TortoiseSVN users should use the "diff" functionality to save any changes
    to a patch file.
   
4.) Upload the patch to codereview.appspot.com.  Go to
    http://codereview.appspot.com/new (you may need to log in) and fill out
    the form with information about your patch:
   
    Subject:      Write a one line summary of your patch.
    Description:  Put any additional information in a short paragraph here.
    SVN base:     Choose "OpenSocial Specification".
    Data:         Select your changes.patch file created in step 3.
   
    Click "create issue".  You should be taken to a URL that looks like
    http://codereview.appspot.com/####/show - copy this for step 5.
   
5.) Post the link to your patch from step 4 to the opensocial-and-gadgets-spec
    discussion group.  You may access the group at
    http://groups.google.com/group/opensocial-and-gadgets-spec/topics
    If you are proposing a new feature with your patch, post a new discussion
    topic, otherwise, respond to the appropriate topic with your link.
